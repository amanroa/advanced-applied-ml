# Project 3

In this project, I will investigate Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviations (SCAD). The first part of this project involves creating the SCAD class and trying it on a dataset. The second part of the project involves comparing SCAD to SqrtLasso and ElasticNet to see which produces the best approximation of a solution. 

## Part 1: Creating a Class for SCAD Regularization for Linear Models
